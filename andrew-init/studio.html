        <p class="introduction">
            Here’s the first thing: If you want a drummer playing in a HUGE great sounding
            room, with the best microphones and preamps in the world, oh, and are willing
            to pay a large lump of money for these services well then, that’s fantastic.
            I would encourage anyone to do that as it could really make your tracks sound
            that much more professional.

        <blockquote class="medium-purple">
            Here's the second thing though:<br>
            you're not going to get that here.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I can’t promise you a huge room, I can’t promise you the best microphones
            and I can’t promise you the best preamps--at least for the time being. But
            because of that, I can promise you a much more affordable price. And just
            because I don’t have all of those things doesn’t mean that I won’t bend over
            backwards for you until you’re happy with what I’ve added to your tracks. I
            can still promise you that you’ll be getting a diligent musician whose going
            to try his absolute best to get inside of your music. You’re going to get a
            musician who tries to not get in the way of the music but rather, tries to
            enhance the music. However, don’t take my word for it. In the tab titled,
            “Blurbs,”see what other people have said about me and my work.

        <p>
            I’m at the beginning stages of building my studio. As time goes on, the
            equipment will get better and therefore the quality will get better,
            but for now, I work with what I have (see equipment list below). With a
            little bit of knowledge about mic placement and how to properly hit the
            drums, I think you’ll be surprised by how good one can get their drums
            to sound. Listen below to hear some samples of what’s coming out of my
            studio.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 3em">Why Can't I Just Use Drum Loops?</h2>
        <p class="introduction" style="margin-top: 0">
            I know many people would love to use real drums on their tracks, but finding
            a decent drummer is only the first step. Paying for studio time, paying
            musicians and working around schedules makes this process even harder. Given
            this, it's not surprising that many people rely on drum loops and drum
            machines as a way to add “drums” to their songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, depending on your musical style, finding the right drum loops can
            be a problem. Even when you find a loop that you like, you end up with a 1 bar
            (or 2-bar loop if you’re lucky) that repeats all the way through the track,
            with a couple of fills awkwardly thrown in. The loop may sound great but it
            gets boring really quickly as it can’t develop or go anywhere. It can't follow
            your arrangement, hit the accents, or take into account the stops and dynamics.
            It's a compromise where you end up writing your song around the loop rather
            than the other way around!
        </p>
        <p>
            Relying solely on loops has other disadvantages too. If you're using loops
            from a sample CD, the grooves won't be unique to your track, and hearing them
            used on other people's songs or dog food commercials will seem to devalue your
            production. I've known tracks where the musicians have used some brand new,
            fashionable loops - but unfortunately, by the time the record was finished,
            mixed and released, a good year or so had gone by and the loops were already
            sounding dated, having appeared on a few hit singles and jingles in the meantime.
