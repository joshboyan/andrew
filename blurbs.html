            No matter where we were playing or whom we were playing for, Andrew simply
            brought it, every time, no questions asked. He always caught the attention
            of the audience. I don’t believe we ever left a show without somebody
            approaching him, asking questions, focused and interested in what he had
            to say. He always had a big-picture state of mind with a kind bias towards
            the listener. He understood that music is created for the listener and not
            for the musician. Andrew’s work ethic exceeds that of anybody else I have
            ever known. Some people may practice as much as he does, but nobody puts
            forth as much deliberate and methodical practice. An- drew’s skills reach
            far beyond just drumming. He taught himself the piano without any formal
            lessons, learned to record and mix tracks from simply asking questions and
            researching, and wrote his own scores for film. Beyond his musical talent,
            Andrew has always been an incredible friend. Because of his impeccable
            humility, he would never admit his talents to anybody. He never asked for
            the credit in our band or basked in the attention he drew. But I speak with
            absolute confidence when I say that I have never met a more talented and
            dedicated-to-his-craft individual in my life. Andrew knows himself. That
            may sound strange, but it is not common for somebody to know his or her
            self inside and out. He understands his place in the world, and he believes
            100% that his life’s purpose is to create, share and inspire. I believe in
            him, and I believe that anybody who has the opportunity to create along side
            him is in for an experience they will not regret.

            fantastic human being. No ego, no bull, he’s the best team player I’ve ever

            Andrew was never late to a practice, he was always prepared, & he always
            strived to make everyone in the band better. He took on the role of the bands
            leader/manager while at the same time drumming like a demon--all while never
            hearing him complain once. Andrew’s work ethic is unlike anyone's I’ve ever
            met. Andrew’s commitment to being the best musician he can be inspired me to
            work harder. Andrew will learn your material fast and precisely, & if you
            want him to come up with something new he will have no problem doing that
            either. Andrew is an incredible musician & anyone will benefit greatly from

            He was the teammate who would never panic when times got tough and always
            had encouraging things to say when things went wrong. It is unbelievable to
            see how calm and poised Andrew always is in difficult situations. He is a
            kid who never lets his emotions get the best of him, and can always think
            clearly. Andrew is a “no excuses” type of kid – he asks what needs to get
            done, and then does what he has to, to do so. He is the type of kid you will
            love to have around because he is genuine and easy going when the mood is
            light, but can be competitive, focused and determined when the time calls
            for it. He is the type of kid who says, “I’m really happy for you” and means
            it. He is the type of kid who says, “If you ever need anything, please let
            me know” and means it. Andrew has such a great heart and would never be a
            kid who is just acting in the best interest of himself. He is friendly, selfless,
            caring and someone I am proud to call a best friend.

            He has a strong sense of pride in the work of his teammates. Because of
            that pride he has a fantastic work ethic, and was one of the hardest working
            players I have ever coached. He wanted to succeed and wanted to win for
            his teammates. He has a way of making people feel at ease, and has such a
            great personality. People want to be his friend. He has this natural uncanny
            attraction that makes people love him. Knowing him has not only made me a

            Andrew was very easy to work with and was very reliable. Before recording
            in the studio, he sent me demos of his drum parts. The first one came a
            mere two days after I contacted him Along with the demo, he sent a detailed
            email specifying why he chose to play what he played, organized by sections
            within the song. <br>When the day came to record, he had all the parts ready as
            promised and recorded them all in that day (in a total of 6 hours), including
            two songs I introduced to him the day of recording. What makes this feat
            more impressive is that he was practicing his parts while attending college
            full-time. Andrew’s ability on drums goes much above technicality. He is
            able to get inside the music. He is a very competent drummer. I believe he
            can bring all the aforementioned attributes to future work with other
            musicians. He has my highest recommendation.

            Andrew has been known as the humble, hard worker of the group always asking,
            “How can we move this even further?” This team player mentality is one of
            Andrew’s best qualities. As a family member and a friend, he has an immense
            amount of compassion for everyone around him. He doesn’t have an offensive
            bone in his body, which is a rarity nowadays. As a drummer and a performer,
            Andrew is one of the most gifted musicians I have ever seen. Every single
            day I would hear practicing for hours on end during breaks from his schoolwork.
            Did I mention his live performances make the show worth going to? Throughout
            my college career, there were multiple times I would bring friends to shows
            and tell them, “Keep your eye on Drew, you won’t be disappointed.”

            not to and carry the song. Secondly, Andrew is an amazing friend who is always
            there for everyone. If it is possible for him to help out, he will to the
            best that he can. He is supportive and motivating--an all around great guy.

            He has been there for me through the thick and thin and has always stood by
            my side. If you are in a time of need Andrew is always willing to drop
            whatever he is doing just to help out. Not only are you getting a dedicated
            worker but also you are getting a genuine and compassionate person. Day in
            and day out he practices to perfect his craft. Sitting in his basement hours
            on end just to make sure he gets a beat right. He wants to be known as a
            wellrounded musician, not just a drummer. I’d say he’s achieving that.

            His attention to detail is unmatched and his dedication to any task given is
            outstanding. Andrew is a wonderful striving young man of high class. He is
            someone you want on your team, no matter how big or small, his input is
            valuable. He is a fast learner and also not afraid to speak up if he doesn't
            understand something. He wants to learn, he strives to be the best no matter
            what it is. If passed on, in any regards, it would be a huge mistake to
            anyone seeking a true dedicated professional.
