This site was 80% coded when I (Josh) started development on it. The HTML markup was all in place and positioning was mostly completed on most of the pages for a full screen desktop view. The client (Andrew) initially against using responsive design before I explained the usibility and SEO benefits of using responsive design. After a lengthy email dialouge about costs and benefits of using responsive design he agree it was the way to go. I implemented the styles to make the site fully responsive.

The client was not happy with the quality of the art work and links on the pages when I recieved it. He had created mockups in Adobe illustrator and the actual site content was of far lower quality. I solved this by resampling the navigation images from the Illustrator files as SVG images and compressing them. I resampled the main banner artwork as PNGs to keep the file size small and retouched the sharpness using GIMP to improve the definition of the artwork.

The client also wanted an email collection micro-conversion on each page that I set up using mailchimp.
