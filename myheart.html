                When I was younger, I used to think that I could do everything on my own,
                that all I needed were three people:
                <br><br>
                me, myself and I.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="introduction">
            It took me some years to realize that you need a support system,
            a team filled with friends and family to help you out. Whether it’s letting me stay
            at home while I work towards becoming a better musician, forgiving me for not showing
            my face for months at a time or showing love in the truest sense as they root me on,
            any success that the future may bring is greatly attributed to the friends and family
            that I have been given.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-left medium-purple inset-xsmall">
                <p>
                    <i style="letter-spacing: 2px">It’s my friends and family that make me want to live. All of you live in my
                    heart and soul. You guys inform everything I do. You live in every decision
                    I make. You live in every single thing I do. My goal is to make you proud
                    to have me as a friend and as a family member because I’m so damn proud to
                    have each and every one of you as mine.</i>

                <p>
                    When I was younger, I used to take things for granted. I thought that many
                    things in my life were things that everyone else had too. It took me some
                    years to realize that that is not the case. As experience, wisdom and
                    knowledge began creeping into my life, I began to realize that what I have
                    is not the norm. In fact, quite the contrary: what I have is one of life’s
                    greatest rarities; it’s a luxury for someone to have friends and family who
                    love and support them be a part of their life.
                </p>
            </div>

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
        <p>
            When I was younger, I used to selfishly take the credit for anything good that
            happened in my life, failing to acknowledge all the help I received along the way.
            This page is dedicated to the loss of this youthful thinking. This is my chance to
            apologize and say sorry to those I took for granted over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is dedicated to my friends and family, my team, my support system to whom
            I owe a great debt. Forget about the help and support I receive as I reach and grab
            for my goals; more important to me is the fact that without these people, my life
            would have no color. They make me want to breathe another day. It’s my friends and
            family that make me want to live.
        </p>

            I can make a whole separate website explaining why I’m thankful for each and every
            one of you, but I think a simple thank you will suffice. If this little write-up
            can achieve one thing, I would want it to be a reminder that all of you live in my
            heart and soul. You guys inform everything I do. You live in every decision I make.
            You live in every single thing I do. My goal is to make you proud to have me as a
            friend and as a family member because I’m so damn proud to have each and every one
            of you as mine.
        </p>

            And to my new friend Nathan Karasch. Without your help this website would not have
            been made possible. Be it stellar communication, putting in long hours well into
            the night or just sheer excitement for the project, your dedication in helping me
            bring my vision to life will be something that I will always treasure. Your ability
            and keen attention to detail when coding the website was remarkable. You didn’t
            miss a thing and you were able to deliver on every single aspect of my design. Aside
            from that, I’m just glad we got to know each other throughout this process. I see
            us being good friends for a very long time to come. This is something I’m truly
            thankful for.
